# 5eXenosPatch

This mod is made up of a few patches to bring some xenotypes from existing mods into line with DnD 5e races for my DnD party, the Heroes of Adrion.

Credit for the assets and ideas in the mod dependancies go to their authors and artists. Thank you to Sarg Bjornson, Lennoxite, Skylar and DetVisor.

Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition is the property of Wizards of the Coast and this is simply a fan project.

I am making this mod for my personal use but will probably make it available on steam to share with my other party members/interested people. Any requests for additions are welcome as I'd love to expand this but might need help. Skylar is also still adding to Fantasy of the Rim and I plan to support any expansion of his in any way I can.

THIS IS VERY MUCH A WIP

- Adds or reworks the following races: Wood Elf, Dark Elf, Hill Dwarf, Mountain Dwarf, Orc, Warforged, Tabaxi, Loxodon, Shifter, Dragonborn using Genes from mod dependancies.
- Adds custom Warforged Head gene, if I'm happy with how it works I may add an Undead Head gene later.
- Adds natural armour and integrated protection genes based off of AG armor genes.
- Adds impressionable and undergrounder genes.
- Adjusts existing scenarios and factions from Fantasy of the Rim to use the reworked xenotypes. Adds Hill Dwarf scenario and faction. Not every race has a faction/scenario yet, but most do.
- Adds xenotype icons for each race where one didn't already exist, as well as Halfling, Goblin, Troll, Undead from Fantasy of the Rim.
- Adds small body type to Halfling and Goblin.
- Adds large body type to Troll.
- Vanilla Factions are patched to include the new xenotypes.
