# 5eRimRacesPatch

This mod is made up of a few patches to bring some xenotypes from existing mods into line with DnD 5e races for my DnD party, the Heroes of Adrion.

Credit for the assets and ideas in the mod dependancies go to their authors and artists.

Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition is the property of Wizard of the Coast and this is simply a fan project.

I am making this mod for my personal use but will probably make it available on steam to share with my other party members/interested people. Any requests for additions are welcome as I'd love to expand this but might need help.

THIS IS VERY MUCH A WIP

Wood Elf

The Wood Elves are a reclusive, secretive and highly isolationist subrace of Elves that long ago voluntarily split off from the rest of their kin, preferring instead to live out their lives in nature's embrace beneath the enchanted forested canopy of the great woodland.

Dark Elf

Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the Dark Elves or Drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth.

Hill Dwarf

Hill dwarves are an aloof, confident and sometimes proud subrace of Dwarf, known to be particularly stalwart warriors and shrewd traders. Stout, tough individuals, hill dwarves are often less agile than other dwarves. Hill Dwarves are known to keep beards, which are carefully groomed and grown to great lengths.

Hill Dwarves are a lowland subrace of Dwarf known for their robustness and combat prowess. 

Mountain Dwarf

Mountain Dwarves are a breed of dwarves at home in the high peaks and rarified air of the rocky mountains. In many ways similar to their lowland cousins, mountain dwarves are slightly more reclusive and tend to focus on mining, forging, and crafting a bit more strongly -- their closeness to the dwarven deity Moradin is said to be a cause of this. It is said that a mountain dwarf is born in armor, but this is likely just a mild exaggeration.

Orc

Savage and fearless, Orc tribes are ever in search of elves, dwarves, and humans to destroy. Motivated by their hatred of the civilized races of the world and their need to satisfy the demands of their deities, the orcs know that if they fight well and bring glory to their tribe, Gruumsh will call them home.

Orcs are savage, fearless warriors who seek glory through death and destruction.

Warforged

Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond the war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killing machine, or a visionary in search of purpose and meaning.

Warforged are fully sentient soldiers built from a blend of organic and inorganic materials.

Tabaxi

Hailing from a strange and distant land, wandering tabaxi are catlike humanoids driven by curiosity to collect interesting artifacts, gather tales and stories, and lay eyes on all the world's wonders. Ultimate travelers, the inquisitive tabaxi rarely stay in one place for long. Their innate nature pushes them to leave no secrets uncovered, no treasures or legends lost.

Tabaxi are inquisitive, catlike humanoids known for their curiosity and their restless nature.

Loxodon

The Loxodon is an elephantine humanoid, bearing the elephant’s distinct trunk, ears, leathery skin, and other cosmetic features. Massive, kind, stubbornly loyal, and only occasionally given to bouts of beating smaller creatures into a pulp. Hailing from Ravnica, Loxodons are often like an ocean of calm. They hum or chant in sonorous tones and move slowly or sit in perfect stillness. As they say, "There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man."

Loxodons are elephantine humanoids. They are massive, calm, and stubbornly loyal.


Shifter

Shifters are sometimes called the weretouched, as many believe that they are the descendants of humans and lycanthropes. They are humanoids with a bestial aspect; while they cannot fully change shape they can temporarily enhance their animalistic features – a state they call shifting. Whatever their origins, shifters have evolved into a unique race. A shifter walks on the knife’s edge between the wilds and the world around them. Do they embrace their primal instincts or the path of civilization?
