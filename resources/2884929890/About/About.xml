Fantasy of the rim is a expansion of the biotech dlc. This adds 4 races (Night/Dark elves, Elves, Dwarves and Orcs) also factions and scenarios accompanying them. This adds a much needed fantasy vibe to the overall game while only using the biotech dlc.

Also this is completely optional but if you want to be allied in the scenario then you will need[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2023507013] This [/url].

FAQ:

Q:Why do you not support older versions of the game?
 A: Because when i made this mod my intention was to make it as simple and lightweight as possible so the performance isnt hurt drastically. Additonally id like to focus on the newer releases so that i can put 100% of my time into newer/better releases.

Q:Can you add support for ___ mod?
 A: As i said somewhat in the previous question i make the releases for the mod as lightweight as possible so that its compatible with a lot of other things including updates and other mods. If by chance my mod doesnt work with the mod you want then its probably a very deep issue. And squeezing in time for that would be difficult.

Q:Update to game version ___!
 A: I will be honest here i am only one developer working on this entire mod. I will update it eventually but please dont pressure me into doing it since there is a good chance an update is already being worked on (So please dont ask this).
